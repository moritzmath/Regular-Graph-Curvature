# Regular-Graph-Curvature

A Python library to efficiently compute the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the Ollivier-Ricci curvature on regular graphs. The implementation leverages a novel formula for the Ollivier-Ricci curvature on regular graphs introduced in my paper *OLLIVIER-RICCI CURVATURE OF REGULAR GRAPHS*.

## Requirements
To use this library, make sure you have the following packages installed:
- NumPy
- SciPy
- NetworkX
- NetworKit
